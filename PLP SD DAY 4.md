3.  Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the
    main advantages and disadvantages of each?

**Agile:**

-   **Advantages has f**lexibility, faster iterations, better
    stakeholder involvement

-   **Disadvantages has l**ess predictability, potential for scope creep

-   **Agile is i**deal for dynamic projects with evolving requirements,
    such as mobile app development and SaaS products.

**Waterfall:**

-   **It has c**lear structure, well-documented processes, defined
    requirements upfront

-   **Not** flexible, difficulty in adapting to changes, longer delivery
    timelines

-   **Waterfall is b**est for projects with well-defined requirements,
    such as government contracts and large enterprise systems.

4.  **What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a
    software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?**

Maintaining high software quality is essential for user satisfaction and
system stability, the methods include:

-   Continuous integration and automated testing

-   Code reviews and peer programming

-   Regular performance assessments

-   User Acceptance Testing (UAT) before deployment

5.  **How does defining the project scope contribute to successful
    project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why
    is it useful?**

Defining the project scope ensures clarity in project deliverables and
objectives. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) helps by:

-   Breaking tasks into manageable components

-   Improving resource allocation

-   Enhancing project tracking and accountability

6.  What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and
    how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

A detailed project schedule helps in:

-   Allocating resources efficiently

-   Identifying dependencies and potential bottlenecks

-   Tracking progress and making data-driven adjustments Gantt charts
    visualize project timelines and dependencies, aiding in better
    planning and execution.

7.  How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more
    effective software solution?

Clearly defining the problem:

-   Helps in developing a targeted and effective software solution

-   Ensures alignment with user needs

-   Prevents unnecessary features and resource wastage

8.  What are the main features or functionalities that make your
    software stand out?

A compelling software solution should have the following **Key Features
and Functionalities**

-   Unique selling points that differentiate it from competitors

-   User-friendly design and accessibility

-   Robust security and performance

9.  What data is available regarding the market size and growth
    potential for your software?

Understanding market size and growth potential is crucial for
positioning the software. Analyzing trends helps in:

-   Identifying gaps and opportunities

-   Tailoring marketing strategies

-   Forecasting adoption rates

10. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are
    these problems significant to your target audience?

> Software aims to address the issues of

-   Inefficiency -- streamline processes and automating repetitive tasks
    resulting in improved productivity

-   Communication gap

-   Data management

-   Security threats alleviation

11. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures
    its essence without diving into technical details?

> The technical details should include descriptions that focuses on

-   Benefits

-   Value proposition

-   Targeted market

12. How can understanding market trends inform your software's
    positioning and development?

Due to the emerging technologies that gives birth to new business model
thereby causing the shifting in human behaviors or demands. The software
developer has have to ensure to have a feature prioritization,
